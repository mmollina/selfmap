Description: Provides efficient algorithms for estimating recombination
    fractions in partially inbred (e.g., F2, F6) populations using
    hidden Markov models and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
    Includes functions for genotype data preprocessing, forwardâ€“backward
    inference in HMMs, and map accuracy visualization. Implements core
    computations in C++ via Rcpp.
